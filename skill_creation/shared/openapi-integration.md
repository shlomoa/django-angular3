**Contents**:

- **oasdiff — schema diff and change detection**: Run `oasdiff` against the previous and current OpenAPI schema before any generation step. Breaking changes reported by `oasdiff` must be acknowledged or resolved before generation proceeds.
- **ng-openapi-gen output paths**: Generated files are placed in `src/app/api/` by default. The output directory is configured in `ng-openapi-gen.json` at the workspace root.
- **Service naming**: Each OpenAPI tag produces one Angular service named `<Tag>ApiService` (e.g., tag `Users` → `UsersApiService`). Import from `src/app/api/services/<tag>-api.service.ts`.
- **Import patterns**: Models are imported from `src/app/api/models/<model-name>.ts`. The barrel export at `src/app/api/models.ts` re-exports all models.
- **Do-not-edit rule**: All files inside `src/app/api/` are auto-generated and **must not be edited manually**. Re-run `ng-openapi-gen` to regenerate after schema changes.
